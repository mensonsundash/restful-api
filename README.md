# MEAN Stack RESTful API Project

## Overview
This repository contains a RESTful API developed using the MEAN stack, an efficient and modern web development stack. The MEAN stack combines MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js to create a full-stack application environment. Our focus here is on leveraging this stack for building a robust and scalable API.

## Key Components

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing application data in a flexible, JSON-like format. In this project, MongoDB serves as the backend database, hosting the data our API will interact with.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. In our API, Express.js is used to create server-side logic and manage HTTP requests and responses.
- **Angular**: A platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. While Angular is primarily used for frontend development, in this context, it's mentioned to denote the full-stack capabilities of our application suite.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, enabling efficient development of scalable network applications. Here, Node.js is the execution environment for our server-side logic.

## API Structure
The API is designed with REST principles, aiming for intuitive and resource-oriented URL endpoints. Each endpoint performs specific operations based on HTTP requests, ensuring seamless data manipulation over the network.

- **Endpoints**: Defined to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for various data entities. 
- **HTTP Methods**: GET for retrieving data, POST for creating new records, PUT/PATCH for updating existing records, and DELETE for removing records.
- **Data Format**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is used for both incoming and outgoing data.

## Getting Started

- **Prerequisites**: Ensure Node.js and MongoDB are installed on your system.
- **Installation**: Clone the repository, then run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
- **Running the API**: Execute `npm start` to start the server. By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:3000`.
